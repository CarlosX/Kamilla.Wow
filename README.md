What is Kamilla Project
-----------------------

**Kamilla Project** was founded by [LordJZ](https://github.com/LordJZ) and [Konctantin](https://github.com/Konctantin) in 2010 as a collection of tools tied together with one purpose: make network protocol analysis easier and more entertaining. The main aim was reversing games, and the first one was World of Warcraft. Later, the so-called *Kamilla Complex* turned into a powerful tool for reversers. Sadly enough, due to lack of time and enthusiasm Konctantin has stopped participating in the Kamilla development process.

After 2 years of constant evolution, Kamilla version 3 features 3 core applications, one of which is the **Network Log Viewer**, also known as *Packet Viewer* or *Packet Parser*. The new **Network Log Viewer v4** is the first major tool to be implemented in Kamilla v4.
